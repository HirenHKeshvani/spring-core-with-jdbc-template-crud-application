# spring-core-with-jdbc-template-crud-application
In this learning project spring framework is used. I have created a service and DAO layer i order to implement methods. I have also learned about dependency injection in this project. Project uses JDBCTemplate in order to connect and perform operation on the database. It also omits the need to write boilerplate code and save time for developers
